## Overview
MONAI Deploy End to End tests are designed to test the ingestion of DICOM data using the [MONAI Informatics Gateway](https://github.com/Project-MONAI/monai-deploy-informatics-gateway) and the orchestration of clinical workflows and AI models using the [MONAI Workflow Manager](https://github.com/Project-MONAI/monai-deploy-workflow-manager).

They are designed to think about how these MONAI components will be used in production and cover real life scenarios. Automated Integration tests have been added to these projects and are detailed under [MIG Integration Tests](https://github.com/Project-MONAI/monai-deploy-informatics-gateway/tree/develop/tests/Integration.Test) and [MWM Integration Tests](https://github.com/Project-MONAI/monai-deploy-workflow-manager/tree/develop/tests/IntegrationTests)

## Purpose
This document describes the test coverage, test data, status of their execution and details of the environment.

## Test Scenarios
The below matrix was created to replicate and test real life scenarios.

### Creating additional Test Coverage
If additional tests are required please ensure:
1. [test-scenarios](/e2e-testing/test-scenarios) spread sheet is updated
2. Corresponding [test-data](/e2e-testing/) to be added
3. Matrix above updated

### Applications
TBC

### Test Data
The [test-data](/e2e-testing/test-data) folder contains all the tests data to support the execution of the End to End tests. This includes Argo workflows Clinical Workflows and DICOM studies used.

## Examples
The [examples](/e2e-testing/examples) folder contains examples of Clinical and Argo workflows for 2 MAPs ([Liver-Seg](./examples/liver-seg) and [Lung-Seg](./examples/lung-seg)). Currently these sit as separate Clinical workflows with the same AET but can be combined into 1 Clinical Workflow using a Router Task.
