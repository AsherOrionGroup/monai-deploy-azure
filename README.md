# MONAI Deploy

MONAI Deploy is a set of open standards and tools for developing, deploying and
integrating Medical AI Applications with production systems.

## Focus

MONAI Deploy builds on the foundation set by
[MONAI](#https://github.com/Project-MONAI/MONAI/).  Where **MONAI** is focused
on training and creating models, MONAI Deploy is focused on defining Open
Standards for defining deployable Medical AI Applications and creating tools and
applications to bring AI applications to production across healthcare use cases.

## Status

MONAI Deploy is currently in early development.

## Community

The MONAI Deploy runs a weekly working group meeting, if you're interested in
