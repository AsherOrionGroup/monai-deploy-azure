# MONAI Deploy Working Group

MONAI Deploy Working Group defines a set of open standards and develops tools for 
developing, deploying and integrating Medical AI Applications with production systems.

## Focus

MONAI Deploy builds on the foundation set by
[MONAI](https://github.com/Project-MONAI/MONAI/).  Where **MONAI** is focused
on training and creating models, MONAI Deploy is focused on defining Open
Standards for defining deployable Medical AI Applications and creating tools and
applications to bring AI applications to production across healthcare use cases.

Currently the work underway includes:
- MONAI Application Package (MAP) - defines how applications can be packaged
    and distributed amongst MONAI Working Group member organizations.
- MONAI App Server - Server environment which can serve MONAI Applications.
- MONAI App SDK - set of development tools to create MAPs out of MONAI / Pytorch models.

## Status

MONAI Deploy is currently in early development.
