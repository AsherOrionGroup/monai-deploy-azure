## Introduction

Welcome to MONAI Deploy! This documentation is intended for individuals and institutions interested in contributing to the MONAI Deploy project. We expect contributions in three main areas:

1. **Guideline**: Guideline and Design proposals
2. **Feature**: Code and Implementation
3. **Community**: Improving community processes and procedures

## Process Overview

1. Create an issue
  * Mention in the ticket if you think itâ€™s [Guideline, Feature, Community].
  * Use the MONAI Deploy template for your issue
  
2. Categorise an issue

 * The issue creator should add initial issue labels, if they can.
 * MONAI Deploy release manager for that release will categorize the issue or correct it.
 * If an issue has overlap between multiple categories [Guideline, Feature, Community], the issue needs to be broken down into smaller issues

3. Gain approval to develop large proposals

  * For larger ideas of improvement for MONAI Deploy, proposers need to convene a group of at least two other institutions members to act as a mini-committee.
  * Small issues, bug fixes and non-controversial features get picked up and prioritized for implementation

4. Co develop work and create pull request

  * Any written markdown documents should follow [rfc 2119](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2119).
  * For **Feature** development, please follow the main MONAI contributing [guidelines](https://github.com/Project-MONAI/MONAI/blob/dev/CONTRIBUTING.md)

5. Feedback and approval

  * There will be a feedback period to allow offline review. The default period is 2 weeks, however shorter or longer periods can be granted at the discretion of the working group.
  * The proposal gets reviewed offline, comments and decisions get documented as part of the pull request, so the community can read and understand key decisions.
  * Once a proposal is mature enough, it is presented again at the working group meeting.
  * Once working group approves the proposal, the Pull Request is merged into the main branch
