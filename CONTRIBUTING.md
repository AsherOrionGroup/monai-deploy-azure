## Introduction

Welcome to MONAI Deploy! This documentation is intended for individuals and institutions interested in contributing to the MONAI Deploy project. We expect contributions in three main areas:

1. **Guideline**: Guideline and Design proposals
1. **Feature**: Code and Implementation
1. **Community**: Improving community processes and procedures

## Process Overview

1. Create an issue
  * Mention in the ticket if you think itâ€™s [Guideline, Feature, Community].
  * Use the MONAI Deploy template for your issue
  
2. Categorise an issue

 * MONAI Deploy release manager for that release will categorize the issue or correct it.
 * If an issue has overlap between multiple categories [Guideline, Feature, Community], the issue needs to be broken down into smaller issues

3. Gain approval to develop large proposals

  * For larger ideas of improvement for MONAI Deploy, the release manager will bring it up for discussion at the weekly wg meeting.
  * Small issues, bug fixes and non-controversial features get picked up and prioritized for implementation

4. Develop proposal/feature

  * If successful consensus is found, create a written proposal and pull request. 
  * Any written markdown documents in proposals should follow rfc 2119.
  * For **Feature** development, please follow the main MONAI contributing [guidelines](https://github.com/Project-MONAI/MONAI/blob/dev/CONTRIBUTING.md)

5. Feedback and approval

  * There will be a feedback period to allow offfline review. The default period is 2 weeks, however shorter or longer periods can be granted at the discretion of the working group.
  * The proposal gets reviewed offline, comments and decisions get documented as part of the pull request, so the community can read and understand key decisions.
  * Once a proposal is mature enough, it is presented again at the working group meeting.
  * Once working group approves the proposal, the Pull Request is merged into the main branch
